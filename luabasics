Lua is a scripting language like python
It is generally used in video games and also used to automate tasks
it is a non-indent sensitive language


Variable types in Lua:
Number 
-string
nil
boolean
table
function
userdata
thread


Builtin tonumber function converts numbers and strings to numbers

type function returns a string indicating the type of the input

\n creates a new line in print function

\t creates a space between ouptuts in print function

Here \n and \t are called escaped charecters

However in multiline strings escaped charecters are not allowed

Ex:print([[
one
two
three]])
one
two
three


The Nil value conceptually means no value.Undefined Variables evaluate to nil.Its not an error


Setting Values to nil undefines them and allows them to be garbage collected

We can call collectgarbage() but garbage collector is running automatically 

Variable  Assignments are global by default

Use local to make them local in functions

Lua has exponential operator ^ by default

Division is always floating points even if all the inputs are integers

Lua can handle negative or non-integer inputs

Hash  operator # gives us the length of a string
=#s

Not equal to is  ~=

0 is considered truthy
